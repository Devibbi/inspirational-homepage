# Inspirational Homepage

## Purpose
The Inspirational Homepage is a dynamic app that allows users to check the current weather, view inspirational images and quotes, and write down their goals for the day. It's like a fancy to-do list with real-time data and a motivational vibe.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Redux (for state management)
- Axios (for API requests)
- CSS (for styling)

## Features
- **Weather**: Displays the current weather for a selected city.
- **Inspirational Images**: Displays a random image and allows users to cycle through fetched images.
- **Quotes**: Displays a random inspirational quote fetched from an API.
- **Goals**: Users can add, delete, and mark goals as complete.

## Future Work
- Add user authentication to save goals across sessions.
- Add location-based weather detection.
- Improve the UI/UX with more animations and interactive elements.
